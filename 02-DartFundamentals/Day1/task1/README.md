## Task 1: Factorial Calculator (CLI)

**Goal**: Build a Dart program that reads a non-negative integer from the CLI and prints its factorial.

### âœ… Requirements
- Input must be a non-negative integer.
- Handle edge cases:
  - `0! = 1`
  - Negative or non-integer input â†’ show error.
- compute the factorial.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts
Loops, input validation, and basic arithmetic.

###
---------------------
A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.
